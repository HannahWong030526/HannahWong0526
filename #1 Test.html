Clothing in China not only evolve over time; it often transformed dramatically following dynastic changes or the imperial decree of a new ruler.

Cheongsam is Popular because it fits the Chinese female figure well, and has simple lines and looks elegant; it is suitable for wearing in all seasons by young or old and can either be long or short.

Cheongsam is usually embroidered with elaborate gold and silver designs. Brides in southern China wear Qipao or a two-piece dress name Qungua or Kwa, which is also elaborately adorned with a gold dragon and phoenix pattern.</h2>
